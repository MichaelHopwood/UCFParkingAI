Observing parking data at UCF, how can we help students determine good parking locations based on availability?

In this study, we utilize a generalized low-rank model (GLRM) with specialized loss functions to solve a convex optimization problem of the "nominal garage capacity load profile". This profile can be used to estimate the answe to the following question:

### _Is it busier now than it is normally?_

The red dots on the below figure shows the periods where the measured garage capacity indicated when the garage capacity acheived its normal "busy" state.  For more information, see the [written report](https://github.com/MichaelHopwood/UCFParkingAI/blob/main/PAPER.pdf)!
